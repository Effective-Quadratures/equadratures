Your problem has been defined by 7 parameters.
Parameter 1 is a uniform distribution over the support 30.0 to 60.0.
Parameter 2 is a uniform distribution over the support 0.005 to 0.02.
Parameter 3 is a uniform distribution over the support 0.002 to 0.01.
Parameter 4 is a uniform distribution over the support 1000.0 to 5000.0.
Parameter 5 is a uniform distribution over the support 90000.0 to 110000.0.
Parameter 6 is a uniform distribution over the support 290.0 to 296.0.
Parameter 7 is a uniform distribution over the support 340.0 to 360.0.
 
A summary of computed output statistics is given below:
The mean is estimated to be 0.463 while the variance is 0.0191.
For the data avaliable, the polynomial approximation had a r square value of 1.
Additionally, the most important parameter--based on the total Sobol indices--was found to be parameter 2.
